# About Flexcyon
A Obsidian theme combining the colour schemes of Halcyon and Flexoki.

I really liked the vibrant colours of the [Halcyon colour scheme](https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app/), and the inky aesthetic of the [Flexoki colour scheme](https://stephango.com/flexoki). Hence, I decided to combine the two which started this theme.

# Features
## What this theme has
- vim mode status (when using builtin vim keybinds)
- Status bar options like Powerlevel10k inspired status bar styling
- Smiley toggle icons and other options for settings
- ASCII art or custom quote in new empty tabs
- subtle opacity effects for UI elements
- a dark mode colour scheme
- ASCII checkboxes 
- Heading options like underline, numbered, coloured
- A [plethora of cssclasses and callout customisation options](https://github.com/bladeacer/flexcyon/tree/master/docs/cssclasses.md)
- Workspace Layouts like card layout with TUI inspired add-on, angled layout
- Configure left, right sidebar and modal background images
- Animation options for tabs 
- And many more...
