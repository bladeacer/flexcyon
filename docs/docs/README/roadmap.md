## Misc

### Style Settings and stuff
> Add more CSS classes

- Light theme color theme flexoki + velocity + origami (currently being worked on)
  - fix style settings and other things in the light theme (done accent colors, to move on to base colors)
<!-- display colors that are written in the docs -->

- Remove Easter Egg mode

### Plugins/snippets
- Support more plugins
  - Could also look at:
    - Tasks
    <!-- - Excalidraw (too difficult to style) -->
    - QuickAdd (override default css variables)
    - Vertical Tabs etc
- `publish.css`

### Other styling options
- Ultra Minimalist Mode 
<!-- Return to Zero, big 0 on ASCII art -->
- Mermaid Chart Styling
<!-- - [ ] PDF export styling (class select). Not happening when it is impossible to debug -->

### Next version changelog
- Changed sidebar background brighteness setting default to `unset`. Was previously causing issues like blurring Calender plugin content.
- WIP light theme (mixes flexoki light + origami colour palette)
- Added toggle for extended color palette, on by default


<!-- Probably name next update Light Mode update -->
