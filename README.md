## About Flexcyon

A Obsidian theme combining the colour schemes of Halcyon and Flexoki.

I really liked the vibrant colours of the
[Halcyon colour scheme](https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app/), and the inky
aesthetic of the [Flexoki colour scheme](https://stephango.com/flexoki). Hence,
I decided to combine the two which started this theme.

There is also a light mode colour scheme combining
[Origami theme's](https://github.com/7368697661/Origami) and Flexoki light's
colour schemes.

## Design Principles

This theme tries to:

- be "reasonably opinionated"
  - Choose between the opinionated Flex Max mode
  - or customising the theme extensively
  - Opt into customisations you choose instead of opting out
- be decently lightweight, meaning:
  - fonts, svgs and the like are not embedded in this theme
  - (hopefully) sane defaults, customisable with style settings
- dim inactive or unfocused UI elements to reduce information overload
- have a decent feature set of style settings for customisation
- bundle numerous callout metadata utilites
