## About Flexcyon
A Obsidian theme combining the colour schemes of Halcyon and Flexoki.

I really liked the vibrant colours of the [Halcyon colour scheme](https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app/), and the inky aesthetic of the [Flexoki colour scheme](https://stephango.com/flexoki). Hence, I decided to combine the two which started this theme.

#### Dark Theme only
Currently, Flexcyon is dark mode only. There are plans to add light mode support. For more details, see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/bladeacer/flexcyon/tree/master/docs/roadmap.md).

## Style Settings
This theme tries to be "reasonably opinionated", meaning:
- fonts, svgs and the like are not embedded in this theme
- sane defaults, customisable with style settings
