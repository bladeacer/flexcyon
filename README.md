## About Flexcyon
A Obsidian theme combining the colour schemes of Halcyon and Flexoki.

I really liked the vibrant colours of the [Halcyon colour scheme](https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app/), and the inky aesthetic of the [Flexoki colour scheme](https://stephango.com/flexoki). Hence, I decided to combine the two which started this theme.

## Style Settings
This theme tries to be "reasonably opinionated" and decently lightweight, meaning:
- fonts, svgs and the like are not embedded in this theme
- (hopefully) sane defaults, customisable with style settings

Documentation on style settings for this theme can be found [here](https://github.com/bladeacer/flexcyon/tree/master/docs/style_settings.md)
