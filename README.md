## About Flexcyon
A Obsidian theme combining the colour schemes of Halcyon and Flexoki.

I really liked the vibrant colours of the [Halcyon colour scheme](https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app/), and the inky aesthetic of the [Flexoki colour scheme](https://stephango.com/flexoki). Hence, I decided to combine the two which started this theme.

#### Dark Theme only
Currently, Flexcyon is dark mode only. There are plans to add light mode support. For more details, see the [Roadmap](#Roadmap)

#### Supported plugins/snippets 
The following plugins/snippets have their appearance modified to improve the Flexcyon experience:
- CSS Banners
- Alternate File Tree
- Highlightr
- Mini Tabs
- Full Calendar

For plugins/snippets that are not styled yet, feel free to open a PR/FR on it.
