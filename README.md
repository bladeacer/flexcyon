## About Flexcyon
A Obsidian theme combining the colour schemes of Halcyon and Flexoki.

I really liked the vibrant colours of the [Halcyon colour scheme](https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app/), and the inky aesthetic of the [Flexoki colour scheme](https://stephango.com/flexoki). Hence, I decided to combine the two which started this theme.

#### Dark Theme only
Currently, Flexcyon is dark mode only. There are plans to add light mode support. For more details, see the [Roadmap](./docs/roadmap.md).

## Screenshots

## Installation

Add after adding installation via BRAT.


#### Supported plugins/snippets
The following plugins/snippets have their appearance modified to improve the Flexcyon experience:

- Alternate File Tree
- Highlightr
- Mini Tabs
- Full Calendar

For plugins/snippets that are not styled yet, feel free to open a PR/FR on it.


## Style Settings
This theme tries to be "reasonably opinionated", meaning:
- fonts, svgs and the like are not embedded in this theme
- sane defaults, customisable with style settings

Documentation on style settings for this theme can be found [here](./docs/style_settings.md)
